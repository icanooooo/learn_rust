# Notes

The `main` function as below is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

```
fn main(){

}
```

Inside the `main` function we use the `println!` macro to print strings. We call this a `macro` rather a function because it has `!`, this well be explored more in the *Chapter 20*

We end the line with a semicolon `;`. This marks the expression is over and the next on ise ready to begin. Most of lines of rust code end with a semicolon.

to run a rust program we must firstly compiled it by giving the command:

```rustc main.rs```

after that we it would output a binary executable `main`. the we just run it.
